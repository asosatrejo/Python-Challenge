## PyBank
PyBank is a Python script that will analyze the financial records provided in the 'budget_data.csv' dataset. The dataset has two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The script calculates each of the following values:
- Total number of months included in the dataset
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
